After a week of trial and error and i glad i have overcome the first of many projects on my coding journey. It felt like flatiron school asking you to walk on your own for the first time. I was so used to hit learn and reading errors to get make test passing. It felt like i finally had to write my own test and use Pry to figure it out. Honestly it felt really good to see the project working. 


The only thing i can say is that; start small and slowly grow the project better if you want later.. After a slow start, and lots of frustration, I was glad i completed it. It might not be the best or crazy complicated, but I am glad, especially reme,bering than a few months ago i just write my first line of code.  

I wanted my project to be about someething i liked so i created it on the Liverpool Football Club. Originally i planned to scrape all the teams in the Premier League( had to scale it down) start small. I chose the Premierleague.com site to scrape. I would recommend to anyone starting this project to look at sites first to make sure they are good for scraping. You are required to submit a site for approval before you start your project. 

For my project, a list of the current liverpool Squad is listed for the user with a welcome message The user can then selected from the list of players to see their stats. The user can then decide to view another player or exit the cli. 

I am definetely going to work on it more to go more levels deeper than the requirements of the project on my own time.
