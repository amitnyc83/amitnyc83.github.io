Just over a year ago, i would not have thought that i would be where i am now. I started with my first line of code back in Jan of 2017 with Flatiron's Bootcamp prep Course. Like most people it was  "HELLO WORLD".  It took me 2 months to complete the course. There were days that i felt like giving up by something inside me that i can do it. Wish i had asked for help on Learn and that would have definetly helped me to complete the course faster.


The idea that you can programme anything you can think about is awesome and watching everything come together is priceless. I also quickly realise that programmering is not something you can master because of the constant changes that happen; you can be very good at it though.

I am looking forward to the next few months as i am increasing the numbers of hours and putting into the course and going from part-time to full-time.
