The Rails project really tests you on everything you have learned throughout the course. It is the biggest project i have done so far. I am starting to see what fullstack web development actually means. It is also bigger; not neccesarily the nicest but definetely the biggest as far as writing your routes, nested routes, creating databases,  join tables, submittable forms to partial views. I can see how Rails is such a big language and why the course slowly introduces you to be through Sinatra. The Rails docs are definetely your friend.

This app is a Appointment maker/tracker that Physicians and patients can use. The Physician are able to create, edit, add appointments to the app with a date and time and select a patient from the database; the patient cannot edit or create an appointment. The Physician can also signin/signup through facebook (omniauth).

Basically both physician and pateints can have many appointments. The appointments table is the join table that connect the physicians and patients. 

I can already see how i could have added many more models and databases to add additional features to my app but due to the time consraint i sticked to the requirements. This is definetely going to be a side project to add all the pretty stuff(css) and make it look like an actual app.
