Gems are basically libraries for Ruby programming language  that contain code that otherwise developers would have to write repeatly hence saving developers many many hours of work. The main place where libraries are hosted is RubyGems.org.You can search for gems using the RubyGems website.


Once you know which gem you would like to install, for instance the popular Ruby on Rails framework simply by typing  'gem install rails' in your terminal. If you like to see your locally installed gems, simply type 'gem list'


One of my favourite gems is called 'RSpec' – a testing framework mainly used in TDD environments. RSpec’s syntax is neat and descriptive, so tests (or specs) are written as closely as possible to ‘human’ language. personally i have used it alot to work through my labs and get all my test passing. 

A flatiron student actually created a gem after his sinatra project called corneal which is similar to the Hazel gem.
