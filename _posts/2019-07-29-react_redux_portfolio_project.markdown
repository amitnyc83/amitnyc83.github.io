The last part of the Flatiron School's course was to create an app using as much of what we have learned as possible. It was to use React and Redux,  ES6 syntax for its frontend and communicate with a Rails backend. I decided to create a shoe collection app to where you could view a collection of soccer shoes and add new shoes and like them.
